# Eos2000DFlashTrigger
 Hack for the missing center pin in hot shoe of canon eos 2000D

On Canon eos 2000D you can't use the hot shoe to trigger a usual flash or studio flash with adaptator. Or you can buy expensive speedlite remote.
I know you can use external flash in slave mode but for my usage the camera is inside a box so the other flashs can't "see" the camera flash.
The idea is to use a photodiode taped to the camera flash connected to an attiny85 who in response fire the flash by opening circuit in the sync socket. It do not void guarantee. I'm not responsible if you damage your camera or something else, use at your own risk.
